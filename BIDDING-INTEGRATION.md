# Bidding System Integration with Wallet Signatures

This document outlines the implementation details of the digital art auction platform's bidding system, focusing on the integration with wallet signatures and fund handling.

## Overview

The bidding system has been enhanced to provide users with simple, clear options for placing bids while ensuring proper wallet integration and financial security. Key features include:

1. Simplified bid options: Min Bid (1%) and Max Bid (10%)
2. Wallet signature requirements for bid commitment
3. Escrow system for bid fund management
4. Username display with first 5 characters of wallet address or ENS name

## User Interface Components

- **Features**:
  - Main button places minimum bid immediately upon click
  - Adjacent dropdown offers Min/Max bid options
  - Shows user's bidding level in parentheses
  - Visually indicates when disabled or in progress

### Bid Buttons

## Smart Contract Integration

### Wallet Signature Flow

1. **Validation Phase**:
   - Check that user's wallet is connected
   - Validate that wallet has sufficient funds
   - Ensure bid amount meets auction constraints (min/max)

2. **Commitment Phase**:
   - Request wallet signature to confirm bid commitment
   - Store signed commitment in smart contract
   - This legally binds the user to pay if they win

3. **Escrow Phase**:
   - Lock funds or hold signature as commitment
   - Release funds to prior bidder if outbid
   - Transfer to seller only when auction completes

### Implementation Components

- **Escrow Service**: `/lib/escrow-service.ts`
  - Handles bid locking and releasing
  - Manages fund transfers between parties
  - Tracks user bid history and status

- **Auction Contract**: `/lib/auction-contract.ts`
  - Manages bid validation
  - Handles auction status and completion
  - Integrates with escrow for fund handling

- **Bidding Context**: `/contexts/bidding-context.tsx`
  - Provides UI components with bidding functionality
  - Handles user level progression
  - Manages wallet integration for bids

## Technical Requirements

1. **Wallet Provider Support**:
   - MetaMask
   - WalletConnect
   - Coinbase Wallet

2. **Signature Standards**:
   - EIP-712 for typed data signatures
   - Clear user-facing descriptions of commitment

3. **Smart Contract Security**:
   - Fail-safe mechanisms for fund recovery
   - Auction cancellation provisions
   - Admin override capabilities

## Testing Guidelines

To test the bidding functionality:

1. Connect a test wallet with sufficient funds
2. Attempt to place both min and max bids
3. Verify that wallet signature request appears
4. Confirm that bid appears in history after signing
5. Test outbidding flow and fund release

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-signature Escrow**:
   - Enhanced security for high-value auctions
   - Require multiple signatures for release

2. **Partial Bid Deposits**:
   - Allow locking only a percentage of bid amount
   - Full payment only upon winning

3. **Bid Insurance**:
   - Optional fee to protect against bidding errors
   - Allows cancellation under certain conditions
