# Digital Art Auction Platform - User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Art Auction Platform, where you can bid on exclusive NFT artworks and engage with other art enthusiasts through our real-time chat system. This guide will help you understand how to use the platform's features effectively.

## Bidding System

### How Bidding Works

1. **Current Bid**: The current highest bid on an artwork is displayed prominently on the auction page.
2. **Bid Constraints**: To maintain fair pricing dynamics, all bids must follow these rules:
   - **Minimum Bid**: Your bid must be at least 1% higher than the current bid
   - **Maximum Bid**: Your bid cannot be more than 10% higher than the current bid

### Quick Bidding

To make placing bids easy, we provide a Quick Bid button with several options:

1. **Minimum Bid**: Automatically places a bid at exactly the minimum allowed amount (current bid + 1%)
2. **Maximum Bid**: Automatically places a bid at exactly the maximum allowed amount (current bid + 10%)
3. **Custom Bid**: Allows you to enter any amount within the valid range

All bids are validated against the bidding rules before submission.

## Chat System Features

### Character Limit
