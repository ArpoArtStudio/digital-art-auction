3. **Wallet Validation**
   - Verification that wallets have sufficient funds before allowing bids
   - Pre-bid validation for better user experience

4. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Deposit collection and bid registration on-chain
   - Payment completion workflow for auction winners

5. **Enhanced Bid History Display**
   - Transparent display of bid status and deposit information
   - Clear explanation of the bidding process

6. **Payment Completion UI**
   - Interface for winners to complete their payment
   - Payment deadline countdown and status tracking

## How to Use

### Basic Bidding Flow

1. **User Connects Wallet**
   - User connects their Ethereum wallet to the platform
   - System validates wallet has sufficient funds

2. **User Places Bid**
   - User clicks either Min Bid (1%) or Max Bid (10%) button
   - System shows confirmation dialog explaining deposit requirement and payment obligations
   - User confirms bid, deposit is collected, bid is registered

3. **Auction Ends**
   - If user wins, they receive notification and payment is required
   - If user is outbid, their deposit is automatically returned

4. **Payment Completion**
   - Winner has 24 hours to complete payment
   - Payment completion UI shows countdown and payment amount

### Integration Points

#### 1. Bidding Components

Both `bid-buttons.tsx` and `quick-bid-button.tsx` have been updated to include the secure bidding flow:

```tsx
// Example usage in a component
import { BidButtons } from "@/components/bid-buttons";

export function AuctionDetail() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Current Auction</h2>
      <BidButtons />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Bid History Display

The enhanced bid history component displays bids with their status and deposit information:

```tsx
// Example usage in a component
import { EnhancedBidHistory } from "@/components/enhanced-bid-history";

export function AuctionDetail({ auctionId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Bid Activity</h2>
      <EnhancedBidHistory auctionId={auctionId} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Payment Completion

For auction winners, include the payment completion component:

```tsx
// Example usage in a component
import { PaymentCompletion } from "@/components/payment-completion";

export function WinnerDashboard({ auctionId }) {
  const paymentDeadline = new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 24 hours from now
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Complete Your Purchase</h2>
      <PaymentCompletion 
        auctionId={auctionId}
        artworkName="Digital Sunset"
        bidAmount="1.5"
        depositAmount="0.01"
        paymentDeadline={paymentDeadline}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Smart Contract Integration

The secure bidding system interacts with the blockchain via the auction contract interface. Key functions include:

- `placeBid`: Collects deposit and records bid commitment
- `completePayment`: Processes full payment from auction winners
- `getPaymentStatus`: Checks payment status for a bidder

For more details on the smart contract implementation, refer to the [Smart Contract Security Documentation](./SMART-CONTRACT-SECURITY.md).

## Configuration Options

The bidding system includes several configurable parameters:

1. **Deposit Amount**: Currently fixed at 0.01 ETH
2. **Min Bid Increment**: Default 1% (configurable)
3. **Max Bid Increment**: Fixed at 10%
4. **Payment Deadline**: 24 hours after auction end

To modify these parameters, update the respective values in the bidding context and auction contract.

## Testing

To test the secure bidding system:

1. Connect a test wallet with sufficient funds
2. Place bids using both minimum and maximum bid options
3. Verify deposit collection and bid registration
4. Test the payment completion flow for auction winners

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Bid Confirmation Not Showing**
   - Check if wallet is properly connected
   - Verify user has sufficient funds

2. **Deposit Not Processing**
   - Check wallet connection status
   - Ensure network is properly configured

3. **Payment Completion Failing**
   - Verify payment deadline has not passed
   - Check wallet has sufficient funds for the remaining amount
