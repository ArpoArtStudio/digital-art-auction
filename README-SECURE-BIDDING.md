# Secure Bidding System Implementation & Connection Fixes

## Overview
This implementation provides a secure deposit-based bidding system for the digital art auction platform and fixes the connection issues that were causing `net::ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED` errors. The system now validates wallet funds before allowing bids and uses a deposit system to ensure bidder accountability.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Deposit-Based Bidding**
   - 0.01 ETH deposit required to place bids
   - Full payment only required if the user wins the auction
   - Clear payment deadlines with status tracking

2. **Wallet Validation**
   - Checks wallet funds before allowing bids
   - Prevents bids from users who cannot fulfill their obligations

3. **User Accountability**
   - Deposit system ensures serious bidders only
   - Payment status tracking with deadlines
   - Clear explanations of obligations in UI

4. **Connection Improvements**
   - Enhanced Next.js configuration to prevent disconnects
   - Socket server with automatic recovery
   - Diagnostic tools to identify and fix connection issues

## How to Test

1. **Run the connection test:**
   ```
   node connection-test.js
   ```

2. **Run the secure bidding test:**
   ```
   ./test-secure-bidding.sh
   ```

3. **Start the development server with improved settings:**
   ```
   ./start-improved.sh
   ```

4. **Verify functionality:**
   - Navigate to the current auction page
   - The secure bidding UI should be active
   - Try placing bids to verify the deposit and validation system

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any connection issues:
1. Run `node connection-test.js` to diagnose the problem
2. Check `CONNECTION-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for solutions
3. Use `./start-improved.sh --force` to bypass checks if needed

The secure bidding system is now fully implemented and ready for use with enhanced connection reliability.
